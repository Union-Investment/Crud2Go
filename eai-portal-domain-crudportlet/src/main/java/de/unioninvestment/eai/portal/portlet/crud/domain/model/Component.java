	 * when placed inside a correspondingly configured <code>Region</code>; @see
	 * <code>{@link Region#isHorizontalLayout()}</code>) then expansion happens
	 * by increasing the components width.<br>
	 * Please note, because not every component is expandable - for example, it
	 * makes not sense for a dialog or a page to provide an expand ratio -
	 * expandibility has been put into an interface.
